            Hi I&apos;m Nazia,
          </p>
          <p className="text-3xl text-mint-green mb-4 text-center leading-relaxed">
            I&apos;m a 23 year old dessert enthusiast providing a range of
            baking services to businesses and customers.
          </p>
          <p className="text-3xl text-mint-green mb-4 text-center leading-relaxed">
            I&apos;ve always had a deep passion for baking since my childhood.
            In the past I wished to pursue a professional culinary education,
            however, seeing as I did not have the means to do so I decided to
            embark on my culinary journey at home.
            {/* I discovered the joy of creating desserts after seeing my family and friends happy. Seeing them enjoying my sweets is always worth it to me. */}
          </p>
          <hr className="my-4 border-t border-soft-pink" />
          <p className="text-3xl text-mint-green mb-4 text-center leading-relaxed">
            I founded this company to share my desserts globally, allowing
            everyone to enjoy high-quality treats, because everyone deserves a
            little sweetness in life.
          </p>
